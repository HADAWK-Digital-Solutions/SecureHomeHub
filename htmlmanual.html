    <div id="Introduction">Introducing the Secure Home Hub</div>
    <p>The Secure Home Hub will deliver a physical device with software that will provide home computer network monitoring, network security, and home smart device control. This will necessitate a hardware platform capable of running the operating system and software outlined by the design document.</p>
    <p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
    <p>Our chosen hardware platform is the Raspberry Pi 4, model B, equipped with 8GB of RAM and a 32GB SD card for onboard storage of the operating system and essential software. This compact and versatile device is enclosed in a housing featuring a user-friendly 7-inch touchscreen display for effortless interaction. The heart of this device is an ARM64 4-core CPU, ensuring optimal performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Operating Systems:</strong></p>
    <p>At the core of the Secure Home Hub, the Parrot Linux operating system serves as the primary software platform. It not only provides a secure Linux kernel but also integrates various cybersecurity tools.</p>
    <p><strong>Home Hub Interface:</strong></p>
    <p>The primary interface for user interaction will be the 7-inch capacitive touchscreen included in the unit. There will also be the option to access the interface via a web browser from other devices connected to the user's home computer network.</p>
    <p><strong>Smart Home Device Private Server:</strong></p>
    <p>The private server software will allow control of local IoT devices in the client's home, with the absolute minimum possible user data propagated to the IoT device manufacturers.</p>
    <p><strong>Network Device Inventory and Security:</strong></p>
    <p>The hub will scan the userâ€™s network to provide an inventory of all the devices present on the network, as well as providing other information about those devices. The hub will also have several network security features that can be activated, including scanning for threats, malicious activity, or devices performing inappropriate actions. Additional related features may be added depending on the timeline next semester.</p>
